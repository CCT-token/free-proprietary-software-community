:wavy_dash: Let’s take a step back :wavy_dash:

### Current Approach: Open Source Software 
##### In the open source software model, software is susceptible to any change. It also means that the software sells for free of charge and can be used for any purpose, including being sold for profit. There are three rights that people have when using open source software: “the right to make copies of the program and distribute those copies, the right to have access to the software’s source code, and the right to make improvements to the program”. #####
  
Open Source Disadvantages:  
:heavy_minus_sign: unfair conditions for small companies/individuals vs. large companies  
:heavy_minus_sign: inability to solve the hardware/software mismatch (Moore's Law overpowering software growth)  
:heavy_minus_sign: additional customization that is relatively expensive  
:heavy_minus_sign: additional maintenance costs  

##### Large software development companies, such as IBM and Oracle, have advantages versus small companies when using open source software. Especially, in their consulting business delivering hardware/software solutions to their clients leveraging open source, cost effective development. Small companies/individuals usually do not have large exposure to client base, making their profitability less attractive, compared to large companies. Large software companies are monopolizing the software/hardware market, making small companies inferior to the larger companies, creating market conditions that are difficult for small companies/individuals to manage or progress in.#####
###### Corporations are advantaged, Small companies/ individuals are disadvantaged ######


### Future Approach: Free Proprietary Software 
The new concept of Free Proprietary Software is based on patent protection of software intellectual property. “Free”, in the the term Free Proprietary Software, means that the software is free of any change/modification in source code (just like in open source software), but not free of charge. Patent laws provide general guidance for Free Proprietary Software licensing, along with a different form of software protection. Free propriety software which is, currently non-existent in the wide range of technology products, will change the world of technology, creating new opportunities to all software businesses by improving both aspects of open source software and propriety software. 

The success of open source was driven by ideas to improve proprietary software. The future of free proprietary software will be driven by ideas to improve proprietary software and open source software. To start off, free proprietary software will provide benefits for smaller companies that are trying to excel in their business, unlike open source software which benefits large companies. It will achieve this by sharing free source code, protected by patent law, and will be bounded by a license agreement with royalty payments for usage. Royalty payment is a form of purchase agreement between producer of the software and the consumer, who may also be a producer of enhanced versions of that software or different product line derived from original software product. Forcing clients to pay royalty is a challenge because the software market is huge and for any potential task there are a lot of available solutions. However, free proprietary software offers a different form of protection for software developers because of the patent that is tied to the software. As a result, patent protection makes it impossible to clone ideas in different software products, unlike copyright protection. Overall, small software companies can build their business based on free proprietary licenses providing incentives to each other, making them more profitable in the attempts to get into the software market comparing large software companies. By engaging with free proprietary software, small companies can coincide together to form a specialized network, sharing their products for mutual benefits. Eventually, the free proprietary software development model would make small companies more efficient and effective against larger companies.
