:wavy_dash: Let’s take a step back :wavy_dash:

### Current Approach: Open Source Software 
##### In the open source software model, software is susceptible to any change. It also means that the software sells for free of charge and can be used for any purpose, including being sold for profit. There are three rights that people have when using open source software: “the right to make copies of the program and distribute those copies, the right to have access to the software’s source code, and the right to make improvements to the program”. #####
  
#### Individual: :heavy_plus_sign: / :heavy_minus_sign:
Losses:  
:heavy_minus_sign: Open source requires high cost of maintenance, that would make open source unacceptable for small businesses

#### Corporation: gains, losses

### Future Approach: Free Proprietary Software 
The new concept of Free Proprietary Software is based on patent protection of software intellectual property. “Free”, in the the term Free Proprietary Software, means that the software is free of any change/modification in source code (just like in open source software), but not free of charge. Patent laws provide general guidance for Free Proprietary Software licensing, along with a different form of software protection. Free propriety software which is, currently non-existent in the wide range of technology products, will change the world of technology, creating new opportunities to all software businesses by improving both aspects of open source software and propriety software.
