# Free Proprietary Software Community

The Free Proprietary Software Community serves software developers and engineers. As mentioned before, the Compiler Compiler System will be used to bootstrap FPSC ideas and essentially will be a sub-community within the FPSC. The CCS is an example of how sub-communities can be formed and how their products can be distributed through tokens or fiat currency. All related CCS products will be connected with the CCT Token. Any other sub-communities created, either a sub-community that works with IoT solutions or AI solutions etc., can create their own token. This setup creates a software developer community where developers will be incentivized by sharing their code through tokens (or fiat). Every software created within the FPSC, is considered Free Proprietary Software, which will enable developers to share code for research and development for free but once they start selling for profit, you would have to pay the developer with these tokens or pay with fiat money. The next sections describe how FPSC can grow at a large scale by using the Compiler Compiler System.
